# Changelog

All notable changes to Burroughs are documented here.

The format is [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Two versions, deliberately independent** (decision 0004, resolving contract
§10.7): the engine's SemVer governs code compatibility, while the host
contract versions on its own schedule and governs semantic promises. Every
release below states the contract version it implements.

Minor versions map to milestones, so the number is a conformance statement:
`v0.1.0` is the MVP core suite green, one minor per proposal gate flipped
after that, and `v1.0.0` is reserved for the v1 threads-and-safepoints
milestone landing with the §4 litmus battery passing on both a TSO and a
weakly-ordered platform.

## [Unreleased]

*Implements contract v0.1.*

### Added
- Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 and Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 adopted, recorded in
  `CLAUDE.md` so the convention survives session boundaries.
- Decision 0004: engine SemVer and contract version are independent, joined
  by a per-release contract-version statement. **Resolves contract §10.7.**
- GitHub as the project tracker: milestones are the phase ladder, issues
  replace the in-repo queues, `label:type:grave` is the graveyard, and PR
  descriptions carry the session-report format. `PROGRESS.md` and
  `docs/reports/` retired (archived in #1).
- CI runs on x86-64 (TSO) and AArch64 (weakly ordered) — build, vet, test,
  `-race`, and `gofmt`. Green on both from the first push.

### Fixed
- CI used deprecated action versions (Node 20) and requested a Go module
  cache with no `go.sum` to key it on.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-30

*Implements contract v0.1. Scaffold state, recorded retroactively at the
genesis commit — no spec-suite test had been run at this point, and no
conformance claim is made for this version.*

### Added
- Host contract v0.1 (`docs/burroughs-contract-v0.1.md`), normative and
  written before any engine code: 1:1 OS threads with no main-thread special
  case, engine-native safepoints, a sequentially-consistent memory model at
  every host boundary, growable continuation stacks, and a netpoller-shaped
  WASI 0.3 event loop.
- `internal/binary`: module preamble check and section-level scan. Payloads
  alias the input buffer — no copying. LEB128 reader is width-parameterized
  (`uleb(bits)`), with `u32` and `u64` on top.
- Decoder error contract: error text tracks the upstream spec suite's
  `assert_malformed` strings verbatim, matched by substring (decision 0003).
- `cmd/burroughs`: `version` and `inspect` subcommands.
- `internal/interp/dispatchbench`: four interpreter strategies measured over
  the same program with correctness controls — the evidence behind decision
  0002. Records closure compilation as a **negative result with a
  reproducer** (no faster than plain in-place, and it allocates: the frame
  escapes to the heap).
- Decision records 0001 (genesis, Apache 2.0), 0002 (interpreter strategy:
  internal-form rewrite, giant-switch dispatch, `uint64` slots beside a
  parallel reference array), 0003 (staged pure-Go `.wast` harness and the
  error contract) — all accepted.
- `make spec-tests` vendors the upstream WebAssembly test suite (257 `.wast`
  files, gitignored — never committed).

### Fixed
- Malformed-integer taxonomy in the LEB128 decoder conflated the suite's two
  distinct verdicts: a continuation bit set on the last permitted byte is
  *integer representation too long*, while unused high bits set is *integer
  too large*. The rule is width-parameterized — `ff ff ff ff 0f` is a valid
  `u32` and a malformed `i32` constant — so a `u32`-only reader could not
  express it. Grave (#2); regression vectors lifted from
  `binary-leb128.wast`.
- `ErrLEBTooLong` was unreachable for every input: an early return preempted
  the loop's fall-through, verified exhaustively over all 256 fifth-byte
  values. This is why the taxonomy bug went unnoticed — the error that should
  have named the continuation-bit case could never fire. Grave (#3); lesson
  marked at the fix site: *an error constant with no reachable path is a
  missing check wearing a disguise.*
- A truncated module preamble reported a bad-magic error where the spec says
  *unexpected end*; short and full-width-but-wrong preambles are now
  distinguished, pinned by tests drawn from `binary.wast`.
- Section-size overrun reported the wrong spec string. The suite calls this
  *length out of bounds*; *unexpected content after last section* is a
  different condition (duplicate or misordered sections), now named as such
  and tracked as not-yet-enforced.
