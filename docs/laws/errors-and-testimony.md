# Laws — Errors and testimony

An error message is a witness, and it can lie while the verdict is right.

Relocated from `CLAUDE.md`'s `## Disciplines` section, **verbatim**, when that file
became an index (see the restructure PR). Each law's one-line compressed form remains in
`CLAUDE.md` as its recall key and points here for the specimen, the minting record, and the
token it was granted on. Nothing was rewritten in the move: the bodies below are the text as
it stood, which is why superseded wordings still appear inside them where a later ruling
amended rather than replaced.

`CLAUDE.md`'s recall key and each heading here are checked equal by
`TestEveryLawIsIndexed` (`internal/testenv`), so the two cannot drift.

### An error from the wrong layer is evidence about where structure was lost.

- **An error from the wrong layer is evidence about where structure was lost.**
  When a lower grammar is missing, its bytes do not vanish — they leak upward and
  get misread by whatever grammar *is* running, so the error names a field the
  input never contained. `malformed section id: 128` on eight LEB vectors was the
  code section's immediates being read as section ids: a diagnosis, not a defect in
  the section-id check. Read the mismatch between the error's layer and the
  vector's layer as a pointer to the missing descent. The same tell has an
  intra-layer form — an error message that reports a byte the image never held (the
  functype tag reconstruction printing `0x5e` as `0xde`) is the engine lying about
  its input, and no suite can see it, because the harness matches the sentinel and
  reads no further than the expected string does. (#36.)

### An error message is testimony, and fabricated evidence is a lying witness even when the verdict is right.

- **An error message is testimony, and fabricated evidence is a lying witness even
  when the verdict is right.** The rule is **match what the suite's expected string
  contains** — and for most vectors that string stops at the sentinel, which is
  exactly why everything past it is ours alone to keep honest.
  `ErrMalformedFuncType`'s reconstruction or'd a high bit in for every negative form
  and reported a `0x5e` array tag as `0xde`: the right verdict, quoting a byte the
  image never held, and green on every board by construction. So a message that names
  a value from the input gets *printed for real inputs* before it is trusted — the
  print-don't-trust check applies to the half of the error the oracle cannot see, and
  that is where it earns the most. Its sibling above is the wrong-layer tell: both are
  the engine being wrong about its own input, one across layers and one inside a
  format string. (Ruling: Scott, PR #37; grave #36.)
  **Refinement, not repeal (#38):** *some expected strings carry data.*
  `binary.wast:1218` expects `illegal opcode ff` — the byte is *inside* the sentinel —
  so for those vectors message rendering is **oracle-covered**, and the invented-bits
  class has suite teeth in the one place vectors exist. The doctrine was never "ignore
  message text"; it was "the oracle reads exactly as far as its expected string
  does." Print-checks cover everywhere it stops short, which is nearly everywhere.
  Read the vector to know which case you are in — and note the shape: the sibling of
  the buried defect is the newly-checked case. (Ruling: chat-Claude, #38.)

### Comments and ADRs are testimony too, and where prose and the reference's executable disagree, the executable outranks.

- **Comments and ADRs are testimony too, and where prose and the reference's
  executable disagree, the executable outranks.** 0003's LEB section said "the order
  matters" and then prescribed the wrong order, so the implementation followed its
  documentation faithfully and every reviewer who checked code against claims found
  agreement — *the defect stated as the rule*, which is the strongest camouflage a bug
  can wear, because review verifies code against claims. The mechanical tell is in the
  same sentence: the order was "derived from the actual vectors", and those vectors
  were precisely the ones where the two conditions do not overlap, so they could not
  distinguish the orderings. An order-of-tests claim needs an *authority*
  (`interpreter/binary/decode.ml`), never a derivation from a sample that cannot
  falsify it — the scope-controls-to-the-space law pointed at documentation. And a
  ruling like this one is discharged by **appending** to the ADR, body preserved: the
  record of what was believed, and of why it survived review, is the part worth
  keeping. (Ruling: Scott, PR #37; the correction is in 0003.)

### When two fields disagree about a value, the suite has handed you a bidirectional control.

- **When two fields disagree about a value, the suite has handed you a
  bidirectional control.** The width-parameterized design's dividend: identical
  bytes `80 80 80 80 10` are *integer too large* as a data-segment memory index and
  perfectly legal as a limits minimum, because one field is 32 bits and the other
  64. Pin **both** directions in one test — a single width being wrong then fails
  the two halves in opposite directions, where either half alone would look like a
  plausible reading. Prefer such a pair over two independent assertions whenever a
  value's verdict depends on the field rather than on the bytes. (#36.)
