# Laws — Evidence and instruments

Which channel carries which answer, and what a measurement is worth.

Relocated from `CLAUDE.md`'s `## Disciplines` section, **verbatim**, when that file
became an index (see the restructure PR). Each law's one-line compressed form remains in
`CLAUDE.md` as its recall key and points here for the specimen, the minting record, and the
token it was granted on. Nothing was rewritten in the move: the bodies below are the text as
it stood, which is why superseded wordings still appear inside them where a later ruling
amended rather than replaced.

`CLAUDE.md`'s recall key and each heading here are checked equal by
`TestEveryLawIsIndexed` (`internal/testenv`), so the two cannot drift.

### The spec is the objective function; the suite samples it.

- **The spec is the objective function; the suite samples it.** The oracle
  answers the questions it is asked — it does not define correctness. So never
  buy pass count with a check that is wrong about inputs the suite has no vector
  for: that is overfitting to the oracle, and it is invisible on the board by
  construction. A decoder that rejects valid modules is worse than one that
  misses an invalid one. When the cheap check would pass the vectors and be
  wrong in general, leave the bucket open and say why (contract §9 G-3; the
  ruling on `data count section required`, #22).

### A verdict without an identity check is hearsay.

- **A verdict without an identity check is hearsay.** Bind a result to the thing
  it judges: the question is never "is it green," it is "is *this commit*
  green." A mechanism that cannot prove which run it is quoting is not a
  witness. A wait that returns the wrong run's verdict is worse than one that is
  merely slow — see *Waiting on CI* for the shape this took in practice.

### A re-run green doesn't refute a fail — explaining the fail does.

- **A re-run green doesn't refute a fail — explaining the fail does.** The
  temporal cousin of the identity-check law: two runs are two witnesses, and the
  favourable one does not impeach the unfavourable one merely by speaking second.
  A flake is a *diagnosis*, not a default, and it is earned by bounding the cause
  — `fuzz-smoke`'s `context deadline exceeded` was ruled flake only after the
  interesting hypothesis (a pathological parser input) was measured and killed:
  34ms worst case over adversarial shapes, 6× throughput margin, so wall-clock
  starvation. Re-running until green, with nothing explained, is the same reflex
  as scrolling past a warning. (Ruling: Scott, PR #27; the fix is #28.)

### Budget by the quantity the purpose names.

- **Budget by the quantity the purpose names.** A gate whose budget unit differs
  from its purpose unit will eventually fail for reasons that are not findings.
  `fuzz-smoke` exists to catch a target that stopped building or a corpus that
  regressed — its purpose is *executions*, and it was budgeted in *seconds* on
  hardware whose throughput varies 6× from a dev box. Wall-clock budgets on
  shared runners are timing-sensitive by construction. Sharpened by measuring the
  runner: it does not run *slowly*, it **stalls and sprints** — 47 dead
  three-second windows, one 18s unbroken, against 605k/sec bursts faster than the
  dev box. So the ~70k/sec "floor" was an average over a bimodal distribution,
  describing neither mode, and *a wall-clock budget against a bimodal rate is a
  coin flip on where the stalls land*. The unit fix cost 65s → 3m26s and the
  budgets were **not** shrunk to buy it back, because the job's purpose is the
  questions. The sweep's negative space is half the lesson: `make fuzz` and the
  nightly runs stay wall-clock, their purposes being durations — same flag, three
  purposes, two units, stated at each site. *A sweep that knows where the class
  doesn't apply is a sweep that understood the class.* (#28.)

### A stateful instrument measures history until its state is controlled.

- **A stateful instrument measures history until its state is controlled.**
  *Fuzzing is stateful — a measurement that doesn't clear the corpus is measuring
  the last run.* Adopting the executions budget needed proof a real crasher still
  fails under it; the second reading was a `FAIL` in 0.175s that looked like a
  spectacular find and was a **replay of a crasher the previous run had written
  into `testdata/fuzz`** — an instrument contaminated by its own priors. Generalizes
  past fuzzing: any instrument persisting state between measurements is reporting
  history, not the present, until that state is cleared or asserted. The sibling
  law is that **a fuzzer has two halves that fail independently, so certify them
  independently**: seed-replay proven by reintroducing a *known* defect (grave
  #18's zero-progress bug), exploration proven by a mutation-only needle *no seed
  can reach*. A budget that passes the first and never exercised the second has
  tested a corpus, not a fuzzer. (#28.)

### Verdict channel and mechanism channel are different instruments.

- **Verdict channel and mechanism channel are different instruments.** *An exit
  code is not a mechanism* — the verdict channel can't tell you why. *Don't infer
  a verdict from noise* — the output channel can't tell you whether. Read each
  for what it carries and never substitute one for the other: a tool that exits
  non-zero on findings is asked for its status, a tool that reports on stdout and
  exits 0 is asked for its output, and capturing `2>&1` to test for non-empty
  confuses a cold module cache with a defect (grave, PR #21).

### Second-order honesty: apply the discipline to its own output.

- **Second-order honesty: apply the discipline to its own output.** Catching a
  figure as fiction earns nothing if its replacement is quoted with the same
  overconfidence. The ~70k/sec average was correctly called an artefact of a
  bimodal distribution — and then replaced with one run's numbers, one witness
  dressed as an environmental fact. The re-measurement is what separated the two
  claims: *the shape reproduces, the numbers don't* — dead windows and sprint
  bursts in both runs, peaks differing 2× (605k → 1.25M). So the shape is the
  finding and the numbers are the weather, and a two-run range is the honest
  representation of exactly that much knowledge. The sibling of *benchstat or it
  didn't happen*, pointed at environmental measurement: n=1 cannot separate a
  property from an accident of one scheduling. (#28.)
